The adventure of a lifetime


Alright jim. I only have first and second period classes right now. So if you want to contact me, send me a skype message and I'll try and show you how this bitch works.
If you'd rather just figure it out yourself, go to github.com and on the main page it tells you how to do pretty much everything you'll need to do. You'll need to create
an account first, but don't let that deter you because I know how easily you get discouraged

Keep your head high and your alcoholism low,
With love, Andrew
